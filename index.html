        <p class="text"> LeRoy Robert Ripley (December 25, 1890 â€“ May 27, 1949), better known by the name Robert Ripley, was an American cartoonist, entrepreneur, and amateur anthropologist, who is known for creating the Ripley's Believe It or Not! newspaper panel series, radio show, and television show which feature odd facts from around the world.</p>
        <p class="text"> Subjects covered in Ripley's cartoons and text ranged from sports feats to little known facts about unusual and exotic sites; but what ensured the concept's popularity may have been that Ripley also included items submitted by readers, who supplied photographs of a wide variety of small town American trivia, ranging from unusually shaped vegetables to oddly marked domestic animals, all documented by photographs and then depicted by Ripley's drawings.</p>
        <p class="text"> How many odd triva questions do you think you can answer about the master of oddities himself, the late great Robert Ripley? Find out below. </p>
